<p>
	Hey folks! I'm Sourav. A minimalist, moody (more often than not), and mildly dramatic (even
	sometimes, when maybe I shouldn't be).
</p>

<p>
	I work as a software contractor. Which means I build software, consult, attend meetups and often
	get to choose my tech stack :) And I work remotely, which means I get to do all of this from the
	comfort of my PJs. I'm based out of Ranchi, but I often travel for meetups pan India. My hobbies
	include reading psychological fiction, watching philosophy lectures, cycling, gaming and ricing my
	linux machine.
</p>

<p>
	I value a minimalist and thoughtful approach to software design and development, and I apply the
	same principles whenever possible. Additionally, I have a keen interest in psychology and
	education, and I relish participating in conversations and exploring ideas within these domains.
</p>
